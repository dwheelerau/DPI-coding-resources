## Introduction  
A shared set of resources for coding, ML/AI, biometrics and bioinformatics. Pull requests are welcome as I hope this repository can become a shared body of work!   

New to git? I won't lie, the learning curve is reasonably steep, but `git pull` and `git push` is really all you need to get started. Once you have a handle on that then try branching, which is an awesome way of testing code without breaking anything in your working branch. Also, don't neglect your `README.md` files; do your future self a favour (at least) and make it easy to understand your code. The github [learning resources for git are here](https://github.com/git-guides).  

If you are new to markdown [here is githubs markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). Markdown can be easily converted to PDF/HTML/DOCX so its a great way of documenting in general and it can be version controlled (unlike MS word).

## Remote sensing   

### Data  
- [DataharvesteR: Preprocess, aggregate, visualise and download geospatial data from a range of Australian (and international) data sources](https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/dataharvester)
### Drones  
In my experience you need <1cm/px resolution to get reliable image detection for plant based IDs.  

### Satellite   
If you work at DPI/DPE you can request access to [Planet](https://www.planet.com/) which offers standard 3m/px resolution imagery of NSW and 60cm/px on special request.  
- [Automatic segmentation of satellite imagary](https://samgeo.gishub.org/#demos)
